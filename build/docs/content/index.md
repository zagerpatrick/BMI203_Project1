# Project 1 - Sequence Alignment
## Due 01/27/2021

![BuildStatus](https://github.com/ucsf-bmi-203-2021/HW1/workflows/HW1/badge.svg?event=push)

In this assignment, you will implement two classical alignment algorithms and then evaluate each algorithmâ€™s performance with a range of parameters. There are two parts to this assignment and Part 2 requires completion of Part 1. We recommend reading through both Part 1 and Part 2 before beginning this assignment. 

* Part 1 - API and implementation
* Part 2 - Evaluating alignments

### main
Runs all code in align/\_\_main\_\_.py, useful for part 2
```
python -m align
```

### testing
Testing is as simple as running
```
python -m pytest test/*
```
from the root directory of this project.
